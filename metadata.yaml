description: '"Accidentally overhearing a plot to kidnap the niece of a prominent
  rancher as she arrives from the East, Milt Dale springs into action. He comes out
  of his splendid isolation to protect Helen and her kid sister, Bo. Leading them
  away from manmade danger, exposing them to unaccustomed rigor on mountain trails,
  Dale imparts his rugged philosophy. Beyond the forest, Beasley and Snake Anson are
  still waiting to carry out their evil plot"--Amazon.'
